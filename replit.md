# Waifu/Husbando Collector Bot

## Overview

This is an advanced Telegram bot that implements a group-based anime character collection game with waifu/husbando mechanics. Users can collect characters that drop in groups, claim them with /catch commands, and trade with other players. The bot features group-specific modes (waifu/husbando), configurable drop rates, and a comprehensive trading system with inline UI.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.
